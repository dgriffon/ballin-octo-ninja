<p>I use <a href="http://www.povray.org">POVRay</a> for ray-tracing.  Partly because it's free,
but mostly because of the great images it generates. The only real project that I have done with POVRay at this stage is my
model of the Liberator from BBC series "Blake's 7".  I started this as a way to learn POVRay and eventually built up the complete model.

The background in this picture was generated using Chis Colefax's Galaxy include file which can be found
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/1434">here</a>.
I have never been quite happy with the surface texture.  It always looks either too plastic or too metalic - all shiny and new, but it does
look pretty good printed as a poster.  This animation was created using ADPRO and FRED on my AMIGA - see my
<a HREF="animation.html">Animation</a> page for more info.
